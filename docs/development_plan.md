# Development Plan for Raycast Extension

This document outlines the step-by-step development process for building a Raycast extension, with clear milestones for testing and verification.

## Phase 1: Core Setup and "Hello World"

- **Goal:** Get a basic Raycast extension running.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Initialize a new Raycast extension project (already done).
    2.  Create `src/hello-world.tsx` with a simple `List` component displaying "Hello World".
    3.  Update `package.json` to register the `hello-world` command.
    4.  Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are met.
    5.  Run `ray develop` and verify the "Hello World" command appears and functions in Raycast.
- **Verification:** The "Hello World" command is visible and displays "Hello World" when activated in Raycast.
- **Milestone:** Basic Raycast extension successfully running.

## Phase 2: Project Structure and Linting (Completed)

- **Goal:** Established a clean and maintainable project structure with linting.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Reviewed and configured `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` for consistent code style.
    2.  Organized `src` directory with subfolders for `utils`, `api`, `components`, and `commands`.
    3.  Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run fix-lint` to ensure code adheres to standards.
- **Verification:** No linting errors or warnings after running `npm run lint`.
- **Milestone:** Project structure defined and linting configured.

## Phase 3: Zendesk API Integration - Authentication (Completed)

- **Goal:** Securely connected to the Zendesk API.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Defined preferences in `package.json` for Zendesk subdomain, email, and API token.
    2.  Implemented a utility function (`src/utils/preferences.ts`) to retrieve these preferences using `getPreferenceValues`.
    3.  Created a basic API client (`src/api/zendesk.ts`) to handle authentication.
    4.  Added a test command (`src/commands/test-zendesk-auth.tsx`) to verify successful authentication.
- **Verification:** Successful authentication with Zendesk API, indicated by a positive response from a test endpoint.
- **Milestone:** Zendesk API authentication working.

## Phase 4: Zendesk API Integration - User Search (Completed)

- **Goal:** Implemented user search functionality.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Identified the Zendesk API endpoint for user search.
    2.  Extended the API client (`src/api/zendesk.ts`) to include a `searchUsers` function.
    3.  Created `src/search-people.tsx` to take user input and call `searchUsers`.
    4.  Displayed search results in a `List` component (first 10 results).
- **Verification:** Users can input a query and see a list of matching Zendesk users.
- **Milestone:** Zendesk user search functional.

## Phase 5: Multi-Instance Support

- **Goal:** Allow searching across multiple Zendesk instances.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Modify preferences to store an array of Zendesk instance configurations.
    2.  Implement a command (`src/select-instance.tsx`) to allow users to select an instance.
    3.  Pass the selected instance's credentials to the `searchUsers` function.
- **Verification:** Users can select from multiple configured instances and search within the chosen one.
- **Milestone:** Multi-instance support implemented.

## Phase 6: Display Configuration and User Details (Completed)

- **Goal:** Customized displayed user properties and showed detailed information.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Implemented a command (`src/configure-properties.tsx`) to allow users to select which user properties to display.
    2.  Stored these preferences using `setLocalStorage`.
    3.  Updated the `List.Item` components in `search-people.tsx` to display selected properties.
    4.  Implemented a `Detail` view for individual user profiles, showing all available properties.
- **Verification:** Users can configure displayed properties, and detailed user information is accessible.
- **Milestone:** User display configuration and details view complete.

## Phase 7: Open User Profile in Browser (Completed)

- **Goal:** Enabled opening user profiles directly in the browser.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Added an `Action` to the `ActionPanel` in `search-people.tsx` to open the user's Zendesk profile URL.
    2.  Constructed the correct Zendesk user profile URL based on the subdomain and user ID.
- **Verification:** Clicking the action opens the user's profile in the default browser.
- **Milestone:** Open in browser functionality implemented.

## Phase 8: Error Handling and Edge Cases (Completed)

- **Goal:** Made the extension robust and user-friendly.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Implemented comprehensive error handling for API calls (network issues, invalid credentials, no results).
    2.  Displayed informative error messages to the user.
    3.  Handled edge cases (e.g., empty search queries, no configured instances) by adding `List.EmptyView` components.
- **Verification:** Extension gracefully handles errors and provides clear feedback.
- **Milestone:** Robust error handling in place.

## Phase 9: Testing and Refinement

- **Goal:** Ensure quality and performance.
- **Steps:**
    1.  Write unit tests for critical functions (API client, utility functions).
    2.  Perform manual testing of all features.
    3.  Optimize performance where necessary.
- **Verification:** All features work as expected, and the extension is performant.
- **Milestone:** Extension tested and refined.
