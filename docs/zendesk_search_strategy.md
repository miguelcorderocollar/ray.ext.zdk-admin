# Zendesk Search Strategy for Raycast Extension

This document outlines the various entities that can be searched within Zendesk via its API, focusing on how an admin would typically interact with these entities and their relevance for a Raycast extension. The information is based on the Zendesk API documentation.

## 1. Users

-   **Description:** Represents individuals who interact with Zendesk, including agents, administrators, and end-users.
-   **Search Relevance:** Essential for finding specific users, checking their roles, contact information, or associated tickets/organizations.
-   **API Search:**
    -   **Endpoint:** `/api/v2/users/search.json`
    -   **Parameters:** `query` (e.g., `query=email:john.doe@example.com` or `query=name:John Doe`), `role`, `external_id`, etc.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins frequently search for users to manage permissions, update profiles, or investigate user-specific issues. A Raycast extension could quickly pull up user details based on name or email.

## 2. Tickets

-   **Description:** The core of Zendesk support, representing individual support requests or issues.
-   **Search Relevance:** Crucial for finding specific support cases, tracking their status, assignee, or related information.
-   **API Search:**
    -   **Endpoint:** `/api/v2/search.json` (using `type=ticket`) or `/api/v2/tickets.json` with search parameters.
    -   **Parameters:** `query` (e.g., `query=status:open type:ticket requester:john.doe@example.com`), `id`, `external_id`, `status`, `assignee_id`, `requester_id`, `organization_id`, `tags`, `subject`, `description`, etc.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins and agents constantly search for tickets to manage workflows, reassign, update, or report on. A Raycast extension could allow quick access to ticket details, status updates, or even create new tickets.

## 3. Organizations

-   **Description:** Groups of users, often representing companies or departments, allowing for shared settings and reporting.
-   **Search Relevance:** Useful for finding all users or tickets associated with a particular company.
-   **API Search:
    -   **Endpoint:** `/api/v2/organizations/search.json` or `api/v2/search.json?query=type:organization name:"Test"`
    -   **Parameters:** `query` (e.g., `query=name:Acme Corp`), `external_id`, `domain_names`, etc.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins use organizations to manage enterprise accounts, apply specific business rules, or view aggregated data. A Raycast extension could provide quick access to organization details and associated users/tickets.

## 4. Triggers

-   **Description:** Business rules that run immediately after a ticket or other record is created or updated, performing actions based on conditions.
-   **Search Relevance:** For understanding automation, troubleshooting workflows, or auditing.
-   **API Search:
    -   **Endpoint:** `/api/v2/triggers.json` (listing all) or `/api/v2/triggers/search.json` (if available, often requires specific query parameters). Direct search by name might be limited, often requiring fetching all and filtering.
    -   **Parameters:** Often limited to `active` status or `category`. Full-text search might not be directly supported on all fields via a simple search endpoint.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins manage triggers to automate responses, assign tickets, or notify teams. Searching for triggers helps in debugging or modifying automation. A Raycast extension could list triggers or search by name/description to quickly find and inspect them.

## 5. Dynamic Content

-   **Description:** Placeholders that allow for localized text or reusable content snippets across various Zendesk channels (e.g., macros, automations, email templates).
-   **Search Relevance:** For managing multi-language support or ensuring consistent messaging.
-   **API Search:
    -   **Endpoint:** `/api/v2/dynamic_content/items.json`
    -   **Parameters:** Often limited to listing all items. Search by name or placeholder might require fetching all and filtering client-side.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins use dynamic content to streamline localization and content management. A Raycast extension could help in quickly finding and reviewing dynamic content items.

    -   **Parameters:** Can filter by `active` status. Direct search by name or content often requires fetching all and client-side filtering.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins create and manage macros to ensure consistency and efficiency in agent responses. A Raycast extension could allow quick searching and viewing of macro details, or even applying them to tickets (though applying directly via API is complex and usually involves simulating changes).

## 7. Automations

    -   **Parameters:** Limited direct search. Often requires fetching all and client-side filtering.
    -   **Admin Perspective:** Admins use ticket forms to gather specific information from customers and streamline ticket routing. A Raycast extension could help in quickly listing and inspecting ticket forms.

**Note on Search Implementation:**
For entities like Triggers, Dynamic Content, Macros, Automations, Views, Custom Fields, Groups, Roles, Support Addresses, Brands, Schedules, and Ticket Forms, the Zendesk API often provides endpoints to *list* all items. A direct "search" endpoint with a `query` parameter (like for Users or Tickets) might not always be available for all fields. In such cases, the search functionality within the Raycast extension would involve:
1.  Fetching all relevant items from the Zendesk API.
2.  Filtering these items client-side (within the extension) based on the user's search query.
This approach is common for administrative entities that are not typically searched by end-users.
