# Technical Plan for Raycast Extension Development

This document outlines the technical steps and considerations for developing Raycast extensions, focusing on a modular and testable approach.

## 1. Core Extension Setup (Hello World)

- **Objective:** Establish a basic, functional Raycast extension.
- **Steps:**
    - Initialize a new Raycast extension project.
    - Create a simple `hello-world.tsx` command.
    - Verify the extension runs in Raycast.
- **Milestone:** "Hello World" extension successfully displayed in Raycast.

## 2. Project Structure and Best Practices

- **Objective:** Organize the project for scalability and maintainability.
- **Steps:**
    - Define clear module boundaries (e.g., `src/utils`, `src/components`, `src/api`).
    - Implement consistent naming conventions.
    - Utilize TypeScript for type safety.
- **Milestone:** Project structure defined and initial files organized.

## 3. API Integration Strategy

- **Objective:** Plan how to interact with external APIs (e.g., Zendesk).
- **Steps:**
    - Identify necessary API endpoints and authentication methods.
    - Design data models for API responses.
    - Implement a dedicated API client or service layer.
    - Handle API errors and rate limiting gracefully.
- **Milestone:** API client structure in place, ready for specific API calls.

## 4. State Management

- **Objective:** Manage application state effectively.
- **Steps:**
    - Determine stateful components and data.
    - Choose appropriate state management patterns (e.g., React Context, `useReducer`, `useSWR` for data fetching).
- **Milestone:** State management approach defined and basic state flow implemented.

## 5. User Interface (UI) Components

- **Objective:** Design and implement reusable UI components.
- **Steps:**
    - Leverage Raycast UI components (`List`, `Detail`, `Form`, `ActionPanel`, etc.).
    - Create custom components for specific UI needs.
    - Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Milestone:** Core UI components designed and implemented.

## 6. Configuration and Preferences

- **Objective:** Allow users to configure extension settings.
- **Steps:**
    - Define extension preferences in `package.json`.
    - Use `getPreferenceValues` to access user settings.
    - Implement secure storage for sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
- **Milestone:** Extension preferences defined and accessible within the code.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging

- **Objective:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
- **Steps:**
    - Catch and handle errors from API calls and UI interactions.
    - Use `console.error` for logging critical issues.
    - Provide user-friendly error messages.
- **Milestone:** Comprehensive error handling strategy in place.

## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Objective:** Ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Steps:**
    - Write unit tests for critical functions (e.g., API client, utility functions).
    - Consider integration tests for key workflows.
    - Utilize testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
- **Milestone:** Testing framework set up and initial unit tests written.

## 9. Build and Deployment

- **Objective:** Prepare the extension for distribution.
- **Steps:**
    - Configure build scripts (`ray build`).
    - Understand the Raycast publishing process.
- **Milestone:** Extension successfully built and ready for publishing.
